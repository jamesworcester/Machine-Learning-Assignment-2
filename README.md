# Machine-Learning-Assignment-2

Assignment revolved around:
- Designing neural networks both with and without convolutional layers to process the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Experimenting with different models, layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, learning rates etc. to try to understand how manipulating different elements effects accuracy
- Writing a detailed report that includes visual diagrams of both convolutional and non-convolutional neural network implementations that discusses the findings
